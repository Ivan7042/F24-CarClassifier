# Car Brand Classification: An Introductory Project to Computer Vision Using Transfer Learning and CNNs

This project aims to introduce beginner students to the fundamentals of computer vision through a hands-on, practical application: developing a multi-class image classification model that can identify the make of a car from an input image. The project will guide students through the process of using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, leveraging transfer learning. By the end of this project, students will have a foundational understanding of key concepts in computer vision, machine learning, and neural networks, as well as practical experience in model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Objectives

- **Understand CV Basics:** introduce students to concepts and techniques in image processing, feature extraction, and pattern recognition
- **Learn CNN Architecture:** explain conceputal structure and function of CNNs and their role in image classification
- **Implement Transfer Learning:** leverage pre-trained architecture (ResNet-50) to expedite training process and improve model accuracy
- **Evaluate and Optimize Model:** teach students to interpret results and assess model performance using various metrics and techniques
